# Contribution guidelines

* Practice common sense and observe applicable [Awesome List Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).
* Proof-read yourself.
* Please be nice.
* Be brave with contributing and commenting (feel free to open an issue, or contact me on [RethinkDB Slack](https://rethinkdb.slack.com/messages/general/team/analytik/)).
* Consider if the item you're adding to the list is actually pretty useful and/or exciting for the RethinkDB community or newcomers.
* In case we gather a lot of links that are kinda-useful, but not exactly awesome, we could create another list within the repo.
