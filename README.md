## Official resources

While an obvious place to look for help, there are some essential, but often overlooked resources that this list would not be complete without.

* [RethinkDB on Slack](https://rethinkdb.slack.com/messages/general/) - get help, learn tricks, talk to developers, help others.
* [RethinkDB blog](http://rethinkdb.com/blog/) - contains news not only about RethinkDB itself, but also from the app ecosystem.
* [RethinkDB on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1kJkmSWt_snLDfuXgJnLnQ) - real user stories, presentations, future features.

## RethinkDB Fusion

## Data modelling

* [Why not MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/) - a dated article with a timeless lesson about potential risks of storing document trees vs relational data.
* [Awesome Big Data](https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata) - gives you a wider contaxt of the database world.

## Node.js packages
